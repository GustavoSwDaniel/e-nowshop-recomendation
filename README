# Mesage process of rabbitmq

This Go project is designed to generate recommendation metrics based on products that are purchased together. This worker is triggered by a message sent by the main system to RabbitMQ, which initializes the processing and creates new metrics or updates existing ones. This project is part of my final university project.
